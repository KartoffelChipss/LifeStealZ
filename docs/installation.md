# 💻 Installation

#### 1.  Download the Plugin:

To install LifeStealZ on your Server, you first have to download the latest version of LifeStealZ from a trusted platform such as; [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lifestealz/versions), or any other **official** platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Be alert:** This plugin is only available on its official [GitHub](https://github.com/KartoffelChipss/LifeStealZ), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lifestealz), and [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/KartoffelChipss/LifestealZ) pages.

#### 2. Upload:

After downloading the `.jar` file, upload it to the `plugins` directory of your server.  If your host provides you with a panel, this directory is often found under a section named `Files` or `File Manager`.

#### 3. Finalizing

Before you can play with LifeStealZ, you'll have to restart the server once, so the plugin can be loaded.

If you want to check, that LifeStealZ is installed correctly, you can either try to use the `/lsz` command or use `/pl` and check if LifeStealZ is green.

_If either of these commands fail, or provide an error, seek_ [_support_](https://strassburger.org/discord)_!_

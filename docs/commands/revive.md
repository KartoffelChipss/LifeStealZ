# 🔮 /revive

## Usage

### /revive \[player] \<bypass>

Permission: `lifestealz.admin.revive` (default: true)

Revive a player, without having to use a revive crystal.

If a player has reached the revive limit (Changeable in the config) and you have the `lifestealz.bypassrevivelimit` permission, you can add `bypass` at the end of the command to bypass that limit.

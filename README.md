LifeStealZ is a lifesteal SMP plugin, that allows you to steal hearts from other players, when you kill them. If a player has no more hearts, he is eliminated. You can craft additional hearts or a revive crystal. With this crystal, you can bring back eliminated teammates.

LifeStealZ offers a great amount of admin tools and is highly customizable. You can change every message and change everything about the custom items.
